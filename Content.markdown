How do I do X?

You can press “?” at any time to pull up the command keys for any action navigate with the 8 and 2 keys. 

‘S’ is a general solution as it brings you to the ‘s’kill panel from which you can use most conventional actions.

My character died how do I get it back?

Saddly you can't, death is permanent in UnReal World. You can still see them in your ancestors but all you can do is start over with a new one.
